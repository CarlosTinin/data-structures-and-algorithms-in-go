----- Rat in a maze -----

Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix of order N * N. It has to reach the destination at a given location. Find a possible path that the rat can take to reach from source to destination. The directions in which the rat can move are ‘U'(up), ‘D'(down), ‘L’ (left), ‘R’ (right). Value 0 at a cell in the matrix represents that it is blocked and rat cannot move to it while value 1 at a cell in the matrix represents that rat can be travel through it.
Note: In a path, no cell can be visited more than one time. If the source cell is 0, the rat cannot move to any other cell. Consider -1 the start position and set to 9 as the rat reaches the goal.

Example:

Maze: 
-1 0 0 0 
1 1 0 1 
0 1 0 0 
1 1 1 2 

Solution: 
-1 0 0 0 
3 3 0 1 
0 3 0 0 
1 3 3 9 

To run this algorithm:
    1. uncomment rat in a maze section in the ../../algorithms/main.go script
    2. run "go run ./algorithms/main.go < ./algorithms/backtracking/rat-in-a-maze/entries/example1.txt"
